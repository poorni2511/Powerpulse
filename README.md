# ⚡ PowerPulse: Household Energy Usage Forecast

**Domain:** Energy and Utilities
**Skills Gained:** Data Preprocessing · Feature Engineering · Regression Modeling · Evaluation Metrics

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In today's world, efficient energy management is crucial for both households and energy providers. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts household energy consumption using historical data. The model helps consumers monitor and optimize their energy usage, while supporting energy providers in demand forecasting and smart grid management.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict household power consumption based on past usage data.
* Identify key features influencing energy consumption.
* Provide actionable insights to users and energy managers.
* Visualize trends and predictions for better interpretability.

---

## 💼 Business Use Cases

* **Energy Management for Households:** Monitor usage, reduce bills, and adopt efficient habits.
* **Demand Forecasting for Providers:** Improve load management and pricing.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Identify irregular or unauthorized consumption patterns.
* **Smart Grid Integration:** Enable real-time, predictive analytics for grid optimization.
* **Environmental Impact:** Support energy conservation and reduce carbon footprints.

## 🧭 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding & Exploration

* Load and examine the dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
* Parse datetime into features (e.g., hour, weekday).
* Create engineered features: rolling averages, daily peaks, etc.
* Normalize or scale data as needed.

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Select meaningful features for prediction.
* Integrate external variables (e.g., weather) if available.

### 4. Model Building

* Split data into training and test sets.
* Train regression models:

  * Linear Regression
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * Gradient Boosting Regressor
  * Neural Networks
* Perform hyperparameter tuning.

### 5. Model Evaluation

* Evaluate using:

  * RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  * MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  * R² (R-Squared Score)
* Analyze feature importance and visualize model results.
